Hello friend!! I am Prady. Welcome to my blog. 

{: .text-justify}
This is my ___n'th___ attempt to create a blog :P I tried to start blogging a couple of times in the past but everytime it ends up with just one post or maybe two. Either I don't the look and feel of the blog or I just lose interest in blogging and all ends up in the gutter. However, in these desperate times of the ***Global Pandemic of 2020***, why not I start again. What if this becomes a hobby and I become a full time blogger? But whatever be the case, my aim is to make this blog more like a "Techincal Diary" where I document small blogs of 1-2 min read - sharing useful commands, concepts, tips & tricks, new languages, etc. I will try to document things that I experience in my own professional life, where I need to search the internet to get some answers.

Hope you enjoy reading my blogs. Have a wonderful day!!
