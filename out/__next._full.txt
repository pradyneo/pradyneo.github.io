9:T116b,So you’ve installed an AI CLI tool. Now what?

## Talking to AI from the terminal

The terminal is already where you talk to computers in half-sentences and cryptic flags; adding AI there just means you finally get to be vague on purpose.

A typical AI CLI is a small wrapper around an API from a model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, etc.). It takes your prompt, turns it into a request to the model, and prints the response back to stdout like any other Unix tool.

At a high level, the flow looks like this:

- You type: `ai "Write a git commit message summarizing these changes"` and pipe in `git diff`.
- The CLI converts your input into JSON, adds some config (model, temperature, max tokens).
- It sends that to the remote model.
- The response comes back as text, which the CLI prints or streams line by line.

No browser tabs, no “loading…” spinners, just your shell and a fast typist who never gets wrist pain.

## What are “tokens” and why should you care?

Models don’t see text the way you do. They see it as **tokens**: chunks of characters that are somewhere between a character and a word. For English, a rough mental model is:

- 1 token ≈ 3–4 characters
- 100 tokens ≈ a short paragraph
- 1,000 tokens ≈ about a page of text

Every request to an AI model is billed and limited in tokens, not characters:

- Input tokens: your prompt (plus any system instructions and history).
- Output tokens: the model’s reply.
- Total tokens: input + output, which must fit under the model’s context window (for example, 8k, 32k, 200k tokens, depending on the model).

This is why some CLIs show a little `prompt: 350 tokens, completion: 200 tokens` footer. It’s not showing off; it’s letting you know:

- Why your “simple” command suddenly got slow.
- Why the API complained about context length.
- Why your bill looks like it secretly includes a second Netflix subscription.

If you’re scripting this, you’ll often want:

- A way to cap max output tokens (to avoid essays when you asked for a one-liner).
- A way to trim or summarize past conversation history to stay under limits.

## What can you actually do with an AI CLI?

The fun part is not typing to an AI; it’s wiring it into everything else.

Some practical patterns:

- Inline docs: `ai "Explain this function in plain English" < myfile.js`
- Commit messages: `git diff | ai "Write a concise commit message."`
- Shell-fu assistant: `ai "Give me a one-line bash command to find all .log files modified in the last 24 hours and delete them, but ask for confirmation first."`
- Refactoring ideas: `ai "Suggest a more idiomatic version of this code" < handler.py`
- Quick translators: `pbpaste | ai "Translate this to clear, simple English and keep it under 3 sentences."`

Because the CLI just reads stdin and writes stdout, it plays nicely with your usual suspects:

- `fd`, `rg`, `jq`, `xargs`, `pbpaste` / `pbcopy`, etc.
- Shell scripts that turn into “AI macros” for your daily work.

Example: a tiny helper that explains any error you paste in:

```bash
explain-error() {
  pbpaste | ai "Explain this error and suggest concrete steps to fix it."
}
```

Now your debugging buddy is one command away, and unlike Stack Overflow, it doesn’t close your question as “off-topic”.

## Configuring an AI CLI (without losing your mind)

Most tools follow the same pattern:

- API key: from your provider, usually via an env var like `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- Model: a flag or config file, for example `--model gpt-4.1-mini` or similar.
- Temperature: how “creative” the model is (lower for deterministic answers, higher for brainstorming).
- Format: plain text by default; sometimes `--json` for structured output.

A minimal `~/.ai/config` might look like:

```toml
provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-4.1-mini"
temperature = 0.3
max_output_tokens = 512
```

Once this is set, your day-to-day usage becomes:

- `ai "Summarize this log into 3 bullet points." < app.log`
- `ai --json "Given this error trace, output a JSON object with fields: cause, file, line, suggested_fix." < trace.txt`

From there, it’s just another tool in your terminal, like `grep` but less grumpy.

If this post felt suspiciously on-brand, concise, and oddly patient for something written after a long day of debugging shell scripts… let’s just say the author had some very capable “help” from the same kind of CLI it just described.a:T666,Do you want your terminal to look sleek and modern? Follow this guide to configure your macOS terminal with iTerm2, Oh-My-Zsh, and the PowerLevel10k theme.

## Install iTerm2

We will use **brew** to install iTerm2.

```bash
brew cask install iterm2
```

## Installing Oh-My-Zsh

### Prerequisites

You need to have a zsh-shell installed in your system. To check which zsh version you have, type the following command:

```bash
zsh --version
```

You should see something like:

```
zsh 5.7.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin19.0)
```

If you don't have zsh installed, you can install it on your Mac:

```bash
brew install zsh
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
```

### Install Oh-My-Zsh

You can install Oh-My-Zsh using curl:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Installing PowerLevel10k

1. Clone the theme repository:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

2. Open **.zshrc** for editing: `nano ~/.zshrc`

3. Update the theme:

```bash
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

4. Save and exit, then run `source ~/.zshrc` for changes to take effect.

5. Quit and reopen iTerm2.

## Configure PowerLevel10k

When you reopen iTerm2, you should be taken directly to the screen for configuring PowerLevel10k. If the interactive configuration doesn't show up, type `p10k configure` to bring up the wizard.

> **Note:** PowerLevel10k requires the Meslo Nerd Font patch, so be sure to accept when prompted.

Navigate through the interactive window and select the options based on your preference.0:{"P":null,"b":"JxbPmCMEpQZLvBAVb0RTJ","c":["",""],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/c6df176e96f13da9.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","className":"inter_5901b7c6-module__ec5Qua__variable jetbrains_mono_707233f-module__9hS9bG__variable playfair_display_ed1802c3-module__hmBPsW__variable","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"font-sans antialiased","children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","section",null,{"className":"flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center px-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"text-center","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"text-sm font-medium tracking-widest uppercase text-muted-foreground","children":"404"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"mt-2 font-serif text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight text-foreground","children":"Page not found"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"mt-4 text-muted-foreground","children":"The page you are looking for does not exist."}],["$","$L4",null,{"href":"/","className":"mt-8 inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full bg-foreground px-6 py-3 text-sm font-medium text-background transition-all hover:scale-[1.03] hover:shadow-lg","children":[["$","svg",null,{"ref":"$undefined","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","width":24,"height":24,"viewBox":"0 0 24 24","fill":"none","stroke":"currentColor","strokeWidth":2,"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","className":"lucide lucide-arrow-left h-4 w-4","children":[["$","path","1l729n",{"d":"m12 19-7-7 7-7"}],["$","path","x3x0zl",{"d":"M19 12H5"}],"$undefined"]}],"Go Home"]}]]}]}],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"min-h-screen bg-background text-foreground","children":[["$","$L5",null,{}],["$","$L6",null,{}],["$","$L7",null,{}],["$","$L8",null,{"posts":[{"slug":"ai-cli-intro","title":"Teaching Your Terminal to Talk: A Quick Intro to AI on the CLI","category":"AI","date":"Feb 16, 2026","readTime":"3 min read","excerpt":"You’ve wired an AI into your terminal, but now what?
